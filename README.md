# ailderlai
ConUHacks project at Concordia University in Montreal. Monitor elderly parents with the use of AI.


## Deployment

Our web app is hosted on Heroku. We used automatic deployments which allows every git commit to the master branch to be deployed automatically on the Heroku server.

## Future

In a near future, having to work on this project for a longer period of time, we would have added an integration of Travis CI that would be triggered before every automatic deployment to ensure that our code still passes unit tests and reduce the risk of breaking the code.
